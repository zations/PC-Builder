The PC Picker Tool is a personalized web application built to assist users in assembling a custom PC by selecting individual components. The website is designed to support both experienced and inexperienced users. Experienced users who already understand PC hardware can quickly browse the component pages, select the parts they need from the database, and view a summary that includes performance scoring, estimated total power consumption, cooling recommendations, and a compatibility check to ensure the selected components work well together. These users can also save their builds and compare them with other builds.

For new or less experienced users, the platform offers an integrated chatbot available on the summary page. This chatbot is designed to answer questions related to how the website works, guide users in selecting compatible parts, help identify potential upgrades, and provide explanations in case of incompatibilities between chosen components. The goal is to make the website intuitive and supportive regardless of the userâ€™s technical knowledge.

The structure of the website includes a main homepage listing all PC components, each linking to its own dedicated selection page. These include CPUs, GPUs, RAM, motherboards, storage, CPU coolers, power supplies, operating systems, monitors, and cases. Each component page displays a table populated from a SQLite database and includes an input box and dropdown to filter the table by parameters such as name, TDP, or cores. This filtering happens dynamically on the same page.

Once all components are selected, the user is redirected to a summary page where the system calculates a performance score using benchmark values and weightage assigned to each component. The system also recommends an appropriate cooling system based on total TDP and displays estimated power consumption. The compatibility check is performed through a backend integration using Groq, which processes the complete build list and identifies if any parts cannot function together. In addition, the chatbot on this page can respond to user queries about the website or their build configuration, making the tool both informative and interactive.
